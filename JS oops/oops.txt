* OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING : reduces redundancy and memory efficeient program
- To structure the code
. prototypes
. new operators
. constructors
. classes
. keywords


* OBJECT PROTOTYPE : Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
It is like a simgle template objects that inherit methods and properties from without having their own copies.
-arr._proto_(reference)
-Array.prototype(actual object)
-String.prototype

* FACTORY FUNCTIONS : A function that creates objects

* NEW OPERATOR : The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defines object type or of one of the built in objects types that has contructor function

* CLASSES : these are blueprints for object it tells structure to store data 

* INHERITANCE : Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing class.
